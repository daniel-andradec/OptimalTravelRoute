A web scraping and data analysis project that explores whether the most obvious travel routes are always the cheapest.
This project analyzes real flight data to compare routes chosen by a greedy approach (picking the next nearest destination) with optimized routes that minimize total travel costs.

Every year, millions of flights connect cities around the world. Finding affordable and efficient routes has become essential to make travel planning more accessible.
This project investigates how the order of visited cities affects total trip cost, and whether intuitive “greedy” routes align with globally optimal ones.

Developed as part of the Data Analysis in Economics 1 course at Télécom Paris.
